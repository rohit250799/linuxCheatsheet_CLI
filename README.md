# linuxCheatsheet_CLI
a Linux command cheatsheet CLI tool in Python

Currently, the cheatsheet will focus on 5 commands, which are also the most common ones:

1. ls

2. cd

3. pwd

4. mkdir

5. rm 

As the project progresses, new commands will be appended to the cheatsheet CLI iteratively. 


How to use this from the terminal:

1. on running: python3 main.py -h or python3 main.py --help, the user can get a generalised description about the CLI tool
2. on running: python3 main.py commands from the terminal, the total number of commands stored in the cheatsheet is displayed
3. on runnign: python3 main.py categories, the number of categories is displayed in the terminal 
4. on running: python3 main.py commands -all, all the commands in the cheatsheet are displayed in the terminal
